# VirtualDestructor
Demonstration of virtual destructors and virtual functions in C++

### Dr. Matthew Smith, Swinburne University of Technology


The code attached - demo.cpp - demonstrates some of the ideas associated with classes, derived classes, polymorphism (runtime) and the hazards associated with dynamic memory allocation of classes, and their deletion. 

### Compilation

To compile the code in a linux environment, you might use the GNU C++ compiler:

g++ demo.cpp -o test.run

which is run by calling ./test.run from the same directory it is located in (otherwise enter the whole path).

### Additional information

There is an accompanying PDF which covers some of the topics involved in this demo. Good luck.
